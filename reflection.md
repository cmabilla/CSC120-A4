- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?

Initially it was daunting. I felt like it was useful in theory but when it came to calling methods and calling other classes with different objects it would be difficult (mainly the passenger and car class as well as the train class in general). However, when I got to the actual coding, I realised that many of my actual methods remained public but many attributes could remain private and be safe from editing in other classes. This made life a lot easier. The only issue with encapsulation/different files talking to each other was testing my train class' main method where  myTrain.getCar(1).addPassenger(myPassenger1);, understanding this took some time.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Please go to TA hours, they help explain all of the connections that you may not understand, like why something is public or private and how classes are connected. Write out the problem on a piece of papeer and do all of the methods loops in a pseudocode/written form. What didn't work was not knowing ArrayList functions. Oracle is your best friend. Also discuss with classmates, you may find that ypou are running into the same error, or you have solved different parts and can help each other (by helping others, you learn more yourself).
